<!-- 
  This file is part of an experimental feature. The file exists so that silent MSAL flows 
  initiated by global components have an appropriate and predictable URL to terminate at.  
  
  When the global header is present in an app, the header will initiate a silent MSAL flow to
  attempt to obtain the logged-in user's account information.

  It is important that the termination point is within the same origin as the point where the
  flow was initiated - hence the existence of this file within this folder.
